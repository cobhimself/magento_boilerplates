	Info from http://www.magentocommerce.com/

	Layout Objects are XML objects that define which Blocks are included
	on a page, and which Block(s) should kick off the rendering process.
      
	Behind the scenes there are <frontend><layout><updates /> and
	<adminhtml><layout><updates /> sections of the global config that
	contains nodes with all the file names to load for the respective
	area. Once the files listed in the config have been combined,
	Magento will merge in one last xml file, local.xml. This is the file
	where you're able to add your customizations to your Magento
	install.

	Therefore, If we create a block with the same name as an already
	existing block, the new block instance will replace the original
	instance. This is what we're doing below.

<layout version="0.1.0">
	<default>
	<!--All settings within this <default> tag overrides the <default>
		layout element for all pages. --> 
		<block type="page/html" name="root" output="toHtml" template="{{designPackageName}}/{{newThemeName}}/{{newRootPage}}.phtml">
		</block>
    </default>
</layout>
